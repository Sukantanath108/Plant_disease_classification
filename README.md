# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Classification using Transfer Learning

A deep learning project that classifies **plant leaf diseases** using **PyTorch** and **ResNet** (transfer learning).  
This project explores how fine-tuning pre-trained models and applying proper augmentation can improve model accuracy.



## ðŸ“– Overview
This model can detect plant diseases from leaf images with higher accuracy.  
Itâ€™s trained using **transfer learning**, where a pre-trained **ResNet** model is fine-tuned for this specific task.



## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Transfer Learning with **ResNet50**
- Image Augmentation (flip, rotation, crop)
- Fine-tuning and Dropout for better generalization
- Early Stopping and Learning Rate Scheduling
- Achieved **~98% accuracy** on test data ðŸŽ¯
